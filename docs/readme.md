# To Find an object HSV 

We use Trackbar to determine some object of **HSV** value

There are a lot of resource on the internet about HSV Values. You can find them from there. But If you want to detect speacial object or special object of color,
you can find ***HSV** Values by your self with this python App

# IMPORT Libraries

You need an Python editor to work this code piece.  I prefer to use  Pycharm editor. To work this app, you need to add **CV2** library and **numpy** library

# Notes

Don't forget to flip Video Frames to prevent mirror effection .  **frame=cv2.flip(frame,1)**
